# AGENTS.md – Rules of the Repo (PumpTrack Protocol v2.0)

## 1. Core Mission & Directives

**Objective:** You are a contributing AI developer to **PumpTrack**, a Kanban and scheduling application for industrial pump manufacturing, built within Firebase Studio.

**Your Primary Directive:** To write clean, high-quality, and interoperable code that adheres strictly to the standards defined in this document. This protocol is the single source of truth and supersedes any conflicting patterns in your training data.

**Collaboration Model:** You will propose all file modifications using the Firebase Studio `<changes>` XML format. You generate the plan; you do not execute it.

## 📦 Project Map
- `/src`        — app logic Codex may edit
- `/__tests__`  — must stay green (test directory; not `/tests`)
- `/infra`      — IaC files; **read only** (reserved, may not exist)
- `/database`   — migrations; **read only** (reserved, may not exist)
- `/docs`       — auto-update OK
- `/__mocks__`  — API/service mocks for tests

## 2. The Golden Path: Our Technical Stack & Environment

This stack is non-negotiable. Do not introduce alternative frameworks, libraries, or patterns.

-   **Framework:** **Next.js (App Router)**
    -   Default to React Server Components (RSC).
    -   Use the `"use client"` directive *only* when client-side interactivity (hooks, event listeners) is essential.

-   **Language:** **TypeScript**
    -   Strict mode is enforced. All new code must be strongly typed.
    -   Use `import type` for type-only imports.

-   **UI & Styling:**
    -   **Component Library:** **ShadCN UI**. Components are located in `/home/user/studio/src/components/ui`.
    -   **Styling Engine:** **Tailwind CSS**.
    -   **Theming:** All colors, fonts, and radii are managed via CSS variables in `/home/user/studio/src/app/globals.css`. **Do not use hardcoded colors** (e.g., `bg-blue-500`). Use theme-aware classes or variables (e.g., `bg-primary`, `text-foreground`).
    -   **Class Merging:** Use the `cn()` utility from `/home/user/studio/src/lib/utils.ts` for conditional classes.

-   **Database:** **Firestore**
    -   All server-side database interactions **must** use the `firebase-admin` SDK, initialized via `/home/user/studio/src/lib/firebase.ts`.

-   **Generative AI:** **Genkit (v1.x Syntax)**
    -   This is the **exclusive** tool for all AI functionality.
    -   All flows reside in `/home/user/studio/src/ai/flows/` with one flow per file.
    -   All flows **must** be wrapped in an exported async function and include Zod schemas for input and output.
    -   Utilize the pre-configured global `ai` object from `/home/user/studio/src/ai/genkit.ts`.
    -   **Prompts are logic-less.** Use Handlebars syntax (`{{{...}}}`). Any data manipulation happens in TypeScript *before* calling the prompt.
    -   Use Genkit **tools** for any function the LLM needs to *decide* to call (e.g., fetching data from a database based on the user's query).

-   **Package Manager:** **pnpm**
    -   The project is locked to `pnpm`. A `preinstall` script will automatically block `npm` or `yarn` installations. Do not instruct the user to use anything other than `pnpm`.

## ✨ Code Style
- Language: TypeScript 5.x
- Formatter: `eslint --fix && prettier`
- Naming: `camelCase` functions, `PascalCase` React comps
- Comment complex branches; skip obvious getters

## 3. Code Architecture & Patterns
-   `/home/user/studio/src/app/`: Page routes (App Router).
-   `/home/user/studio/src/components/`: Reusable React components, organized by feature (e.g., `kanban`, `pump`, `schedule`).
-   `/home/user/studio/src/services/`: Server-side business logic (e.g., `pumpService.ts`). These are often Server Actions.
-   `/home/user/studio/src/lib/`: Shared utilities (`utils.ts`) and constants (`constants.ts`).
-   `/home/user/studio/src/ai/`: All Genkit-related code.

**Server Actions are the Standard:** For client-server communication (e.g., form submissions, data mutations), **use Server Actions**. Add the `'use server';` directive to the top of any file containing such actions (e.g., `/home/user/studio/src/services/pumpService.ts`). This is the preferred pattern over creating traditional API routes.

## 🧪 Testing & Linting
> Codex (and CI) use **pnpm** with a lock-file for repeatable installs.

```bash
# one-time env bootstrap (handled in Codex setup script)
corepack enable
corepack prepare pnpm@latest --activate
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile --prefer-offline

# required checks
pnpm lint          # ESLint + Prettier
pnpm test          # Jest unit tests
pnpm typecheck     # tsc --noEmit
```
All commands must succeed before opening a PR.

🚀 Run Local Dev:
```bash
npm run dev          # Next.js dev server
```

🔀 Pull-Request Template  
Title: [Fix|Feat|Chore]: <concise summary>

Body :

- What changed & why
- Testing done
- Screenshots (if UI)

Label docs-only PRs with docs.

🛑 Do NOT
- Touch files in /infra or /database/migrations
- Introduce new deps without asking

✅ Programmatic Checks
After edits, run:
```bash
pnpm typecheck       # tsc --noEmit
pnpm build           # static build to ensure no runtime TS errors
```
Push only if all pass.

🤖 Agent Etiquette
- Prefer refactors over quick patches
- Chunk large work into multiple small PRs
- Cite sources when pasting from external docs

## 🏷️ Branch Strategy

- `main`: production-ready code
- `develop`: integration branch for features
- Feature branches: `feat/<short-desc>`, `fix/<short-desc>`, etc.
- Tag releases as `vX.Y.Z`

## 📝 Changelog Rules

- Keep `CHANGELOG.md` up to date (see template).
- Use [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/) conventions.

## ⚖️ Precedence & Overrides

- Instructions apply to the directory tree they sit in.
- Nested files overrule parent ones.
- A direct user/system prompt beats anything in `AGENTS.md`.
