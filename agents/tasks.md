  **Status:** âœ… Complete  
  **Validation:** All quality checks passing (typecheck, test, lint, coverage)

### 2025-01-16 - MCP Setup & Project Organization

**Agent:** Kiro Assistant  
**Task:** MCP configuration and project organization  
**Output:**

- Created /agents/tasks.md for tracking agent work
- Organized /specs/ folder with modular structure (utils/, components/, services/, ai/, api/)
- Moved capitalize-feature.md to /specs/utils/
- Created MCP configuration in .kiro/settings/mcp.json with sequential, firebase, puppeteer, context7

  **Status:** âœ… Complete  
  **Validation:** All files created and organized properly

### 2025-07-17 - Development Hooks & Enhanced AI Agents

**Agent:** Kiro Assistant  
**Task:** Create development hooks and enhance AI test generation  
**Output:**

- Created 11 development hooks for automated workflows:
  - auto-test-generation.json (generates tests on file creation)
  - spec-to-implementation.json (generates code from specs)
  - continuous-testing.json (runs tests on file changes)
  - ai-code-review.json (AI reviews before commits)
  - auto-coverage-check.json (coverage on test changes)
  - pre-commit-quality-gate.json (quality checks before commits)
- Enhanced AI agents with smarter test generation:
  - Improved acceptance criteria parsing (GIVEN/WHEN/THEN)
  - Added type detection from specs
  - Better edge case handling
  - Property-based testing (idempotence, immutability)
- Created supporting scripts:
  - scripts/ai-code-review.ts (AI-powered code analysis)
  - Enhanced scripts/generate-tests.ts (smarter test generation)
- Fixed path handling issues in run-agents.ts
- Created truncate utility spec as test case
- Fixed capitalize test issues (null/undefined handling)
  **Status:** âœ… Complete  
  **Validation:** All hooks created, AI agents enhanced, path issues resolved
