# PumpTrack Project Analysis

## Project Overview
- **Name**: PumpTrack (package.json shows "nextn" - likely needs alignment)
- **Purpose**: Kanban and scheduling application for industrial pump manufacturing
- **Tech Stack**: Next.js 15 + TypeScript + Firebase + ShadCN UI + Tailwind
- **Package Manager**: pnpm (enforced via preinstall script)

## Architecture Assessment

### ✅ Strengths
1. **Well-defined protocols** - AGENTS.md provides comprehensive development standards
2. **Modern stack** - Next.js 15 with App Router, TypeScript strict mode
3. **Testing setup** - Vitest configured with coverage thresholds
4. **Component library** - ShadCN UI properly integrated
5. **Firebase integration** - Admin SDK properly configured with emulator support
6. **AI integration** - Genkit flows for AI functionality

### ⚠️ Areas for Improvement
1. **Package name mismatch** - package.json shows "nextn" but project is "PumpTrack"
2. **TypeScript config** - strict: false (should be true per AGENTS.md)
3. **Testing coverage** - Only capitalize.ts has coverage enforcement
4. **Missing dependencies** - Some testing tools mentioned in protocol not installed
5. **Empty orchestration** - run-agents.ts is empty
6. **Documentation gaps** - Some referenced files don't exist

## File Structure Analysis

### Current Structure (Good)
```
src/
├── ai/           # Genkit flows and AI logic
├── app/          # Next.js App Router pages
├── components/   # React components (organized by feature)
├── hooks/        # Custom React hooks
├── lib/          # Shared utilities and Firebase config
├── services/     # Server-side business logic
├── types/        # TypeScript type definitions
└── utils/        # Pure utility functions
```

### Testing Structure
```
__tests__/
└── utils/
    └── capitalize.spec.ts  # Only test file currently
```

## Dependencies Analysis

### Production Dependencies ✅
- Core: Next.js 15, React 18, TypeScript
- UI: ShadCN components, Tailwind, Lucide icons
- Backend: Firebase Admin, Firestore
- AI: Genkit with Google AI
- Forms: React Hook Form with Zod validation
- State: TanStack Query, SWR
- Utils: date-fns, clsx, tailwind-merge

### Dev Dependencies ✅
- Testing: Vitest, Testing Library, jsdom
- Linting: ESLint with Next.js config
- Build: TypeScript, PostCSS, Tailwind

### Missing Dependencies (per testingProtocol_v1.md)
- playwright (for E2E tests)
- fast-check (for property-based testing)
- faker (for test data generation)

## Configuration Issues

### vitest.config.ts
- Has syntax error (extra closing brace)
- Coverage only includes capitalize.ts
- Should include all src files

### tsconfig.json
- strict: false (should be true)
- Excludes vitest.config.ts (unnecessary)

## Current Implementation Status
- ✅ Basic project structure
- ✅ One utility function (capitalize) with tests
- ✅ Firebase setup
- ✅ UI components structure
- ❌ Multi-agent testing workflow
- ❌ Comprehensive test coverage
- ❌ Agent orchestration script

## Next Steps Needed
1. Fix configuration issues
2. Install missing testing dependencies
3. Implement run-agents.ts orchestration
4. Expand test coverage
5. Align package naming
6. Complete testing protocol implementation
